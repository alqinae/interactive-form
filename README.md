# Interactive Form:
- This project is about an interactive form with validation and accessibility features.

- It is done by: **Khaled Alqenaei**, and I am looking forward to getting an **"Exceeds Expectation"** evaluation.

# To run this project:
1- Clone the project

2- Double-click on `index.html` to run it on your preferred web browser.

3- You can fill up the form fields and notice the form validation and accessibility features.
Name and email fields are having real time validation.

4- To submit the form successfully, the name should be filled (not blank spaces or empty). Also, the email should be formatted correctly.
You have to choose at least one activity as well. All the chosen activities should not have time conflicts. Finally, if you chose the credit card option, then you have to fill the card number, cvv and zipcode.
If you didn't fill the fields mentioned previously, the form will not be submitted, i.e. the default behaviour will be prevented. Otherwise, it will be submitted and the fields will be reset.
